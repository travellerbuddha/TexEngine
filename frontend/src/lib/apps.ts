/*  The Kamra app suite. One PMS, several apps - like a workspace suite:
    Front Desk is where the day happens; Housekeeping, Operations, Events,
    Revenue, Finance and Admin are their own rooms. The switcher in the top
    bar and the /apps launcher move between them; Search (Ctrl/Cmd+K) jumps
    anywhere and the sidebar follows.

    Every app is open and included - Kamra is fully open source. */
